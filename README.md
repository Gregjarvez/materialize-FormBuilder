# materialize-FormBuilder-GUI
Hi there! My name's GREGORY and I'm a javascript developer,  a beginner javascript developer to be precise :). This project focuses on developing a GUI for the materialize framework and to make building form component easy. The project as at now is in the early development stage with a few form components built and functional.
Also the application is built using react.
